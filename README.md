# NixOS Configs

basic; sway.nix is obsolete.

don't forget to define hostname in local.nix! Also, `system.stateVersion` should
be in local.nix.

local.nix
```nix
{
    networking.hostName = "<name>"; # Define your hostname.
  
    # This value determines the NixOS release from which the default
    # settings for stateful data, like file locations and database versions
    # on your system were taken. Itâ€˜s perfectly fine and recommended to leave
    # this value at the release version of the first install of this system.
    # Before changing this value read the documentation for this option
    # (e.g. man configuration.nix or on https://nixos.org/nixos/options.html).
    system.stateVersion = "24.11"; # Did you read the comment?
}
```
